   The CyberGame (v1.0)
==========================

![screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb3fadc-642e-4d22-9500-a10eeac71340)

This directory contains a small word-based game written in Batch. At each round, the goal is to find the right word related to the cybersecurity field. Good answers give 1 point, wrong ones don't give any. At any time, the player can type the HELP command to access the help screen. There are as many rounds as the number of non-empty lines in the game's data file.

Script written for learning purposes only.


Future work
-----------

A few ideas that could be implemented to improve the game:
- Add a CLUE command to help the player for hard words.
- Add a random system to manage the hidden chars.
- A system to randomly select 15 lines in the data file. That would allow the data file to contain more words.
- Add a dedicated credits / about screen.
